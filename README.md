# Hello, App Engine

This is an application for learning how to use Google App Engine. It's not intended to
use in production.

# How to use it

Just install all dependencies in `requirements.txt` and use `uvicorn` to run
the server. The file for deployment is in `app.yaml` as the specification said.

I cannot reveal the demo because I fear the spammer.
